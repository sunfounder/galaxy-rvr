Updating the Firmware File
======================================

1. Download the firmwarefile.

    * :download:`GalaxyRVR Firmware File <https://github.com/sunfounder/galaxy-rvr/releases/download/1.2.0/galaxy-rvr-1.2.0.zip>`

2. Connect your mobile devices (such as phones or tablets) to the WiFi hotspot emitted by the GalaxyRVR. 
Typically, the SSID is ``GalaxyRVR``, and the password is ``12345678``.
