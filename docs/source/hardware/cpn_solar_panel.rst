Solar panels are devices that convert sunlight into electricity. They are made up of photovoltaic (PV) cells, which are made of semiconductor materials such as silicon. When sunlight hits a PV cell, it knocks electrons loose from their atoms. These electrons flow through the cell, creating an electric current.

Solar panels can be used to generate electricity for a variety of purposes, including powering homes, businesses, and even entire communities. They are a clean and renewable source of energy that can help reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.
