Lesson 12 Camera System
================================================

Welcome back, young explorers! In the last lesson, we equipped our GalaxyRVR with the ability to "nod" using a tilt mechanism. Now, it's time to give our Rover "eyes" - the camera!

In this thrilling journey, we'll dive into the setup of the Rover's camera system. You'll learn how to relay the visuals captured by the Rover's camera to the APP, so you can see exactly what the Rover sees in real-time. Imagine the excitement of experiencing the Martian landscape from the Rover's perspective!

This offers an even more interactive and engaging experience with our GalaxyRVR. Stay tuned for more adventures!

Introduction to ESP32 CAM
-------------------------------------------------------

In our previous adventure, we equipped our Mars Rover with a pair of "eyes" by integrating the ESP32 CAM. Today, we're going to learn more about it and actually make it "see."

The ESP32 CAM, acting like the eyes of our Rover, is a small yet powerful module. Not only does it integrate Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionalities, but it also comes with a compact camera. This camera helps our Rover capture images of its surroundings.

Just like we use our eyes to observe our environment, the ESP32 CAM can "see" what lies ahead for the Rover, then send these visual data to our smartphone or computer. This allows us to see everything the Rover sees in real-time!

It's as if we're piloting the Rover directly, observing not just the Rover itself, but also the world it explores! Incredible, isn't it? So, let's dive deeper into it...

Exploring the Mars Rover Visual System
----------------------------------------------------

1. Drag a ``turn camera ON`` block. Click it, and you'll see the background of the stage display the camera's feed.

2. If you see the camera feed inverted, a ``set camera image orientation to inverted`` block can help you correct it.

3. Drag a ``turn camera LED ON`` block. Click it, and the LED next to the GalaxyRVR camera will light up.

**Click the Sprite to Turn On the Camera**

4. Now that we know how to control the camera module, create four new sprites to control the camera and its LED. Adjust their sizes to make them look harmonious.

5. Program each sprite: clicking sprite 1 will turn off the camera.

9. To save space on the stage, stack each set of controls.

10. Add a ``go to back layer`` block for each sprite. When clicked, the sprite will move to the back layer, revealing the next sprite, creating a toggle effect.
