Lesson 8 Advanced Obstacle Avoidance
==================================================

The obstacle avoidance module, as the name suggests, helps our Rover avoid obstacles. It detects obstacles by transmitting an infrared signal and then receiving the signal reflected back from the object. If there is an obstacle in front of the module, the infrared signal is reflected back, and the module detects it.

Now, adding an ultrasonic sensor to the mix improves this system. Ultrasonic sensors measure distance by sending out a sound wave at a specific frequency and listening for that sound wave to bounce back. By recording the elapsed time between the sound wave being generated and the sound wave bouncing back, it is possible to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object.

Combining these two gives us a reliable, efficient, and versatile obstacle avoidance system!

Constructing Advanced Obstacle Avoidance Systems
-----------------------------------------------------------

In previous lessons, we learned the basics of using infrared sensors for obstacle avoidance. We also explored the principles of ultrasonic modules. Now, we will put all these parts together to build an advanced obstacle avoidance system!

Our enhanced Mars Rover will now navigate its surroundings using both ultrasonic and infrared sensors.

1. We can use the code block from :ref:`ir_obstacle` as a template. Open it from your saved projects.

2. Then, save it as a copy.

3. Rename the project and save it.

4. Add distance detection using the ultrasonic sensor. Drag a ``when distance < 15 cm`` block.

5. Similarly, drag a ``stop other scripts in sprite`` block to ensure the GalaxyRVR only responds to one sensor at a time.

6. Move backward until reaching a safe distance.

7. Turn for one second (either left or right).

8. Move forward again.

Now, the IR sensors on both sides and the ultrasonic sensor in the front will work together to form a powerful obstacle avoidance system, ensuring the GalaxyRVR does not collide with any obstacles during its missions.
