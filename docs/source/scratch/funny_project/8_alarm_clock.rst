2.8 Light Alarm Clock
======================

In life, there are various kinds of time alarm clocks. Now let's make a light-controlled alarm clock. When morning comes, the brightness of light increases and this light-controlled alarm clock will remind you that it's time to get up.

Build the Circuit
-----------------------

A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity.

Build the circuit according to the following diagram.

Connect one end of the photoresistor to 5V, the other end to A0, and connect a 10K resistor in series with GND at this end.

So when the light intensity increases, the resistance of a photoresistor decreases, the voltage division of the 10K resistor increases, and the value obtained by A0 becomes larger.

Programming
------------------

**1. Select a sprite**

Delete the default sprite, click the **Choose a Sprite** button in the lower right corner of the sprite area, enter **bell** in the search box, and then click to add it.

**2. Read the value of A0**

Create two variables **before** and **current**. When green flag is clicked, read the value of A0 and store it in variable **before** as a reference value. In [forever], read the value of A0 again, store it in the variable **current**.

**3. Make a sound**

When the value of current A0 is greater than the previous 50, which represents the current light intensity is greater than the threshold, then let the sprite make a sound.

**4. Turning the sprite**

Use [turn block] to make the **bell** sprite turn left and right to achieve the alarm effect.

**5. stop all**

Stops the alarm when it has been ringing for a while.
