Lesson 13 Realtime Control
=======================================

We have now explored most of the features of the GalaxyRVR. To complete our journey and transform the GalaxyRVR into a fully functional robot, we need to combine the three main components we've covered.

1. :ref:`rgb_move` : This section includes movement and lighting effects.

2. :ref:`tilt_system` : This part involves adjusting the direction of the camera gimbal.

3. :ref:`camera_system` : This part includes the camera and LED control features.

**Move & RGB System**

Let's enhance the movement functionalities. We have already coded these in the :ref:`rgb_move` section.

We recommend placing these code blocks in the Backdrops. This way, modifying the sprite's code won't affect this functionality.

**Tilt System**

This part is the same as the :ref:`tilt_system`. Simply repeat the steps.

**Camera System**

For this part, repeat the steps from :ref:`camera_system`.

Now, you can click the sprites to turn the camera and LED on or off, and use the arrow keys to move the GalaxyRVR.
