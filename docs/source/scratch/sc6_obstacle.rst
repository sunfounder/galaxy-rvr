Lesson 6 IR Obstacle
===========================

We're diving into the world of the Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Module. Tucked at the sides of our Mars Rover, these sensors act as the rover's "eyes," helping it dodge side obstacles and safely navigate the Martian landscape.

We'll learn how to integrate these modules with our rover, unravel the magic behind their functioning, and develop code to make our rover smartly sidestep any hurdles it comes across.

Get ready to gear up our rover with some Martian obstacle-dodging intelligence! Let's get rolling!

Demystifying the Module
-------------------------------------

Meet the Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Module - our rover's smart sidekick. This little device is a pack of wonders. Let's take a tour:

Here are the pin definitions:

* **GND**: This is like the module's anchor, connecting it to the ground or common point in the circuit.
* **+**: Here's where the module gets its energy, needing a power supply of 3.3 to 5V DC.
* **Out**: This is the module's communicator. By default, it stays high and only goes low when it spots an obstacle.
* **EN**: Meet the module's controller. This **enable** pin decides when the module should work. By default, it is connected to GND, meaning the module is always on the job.


Curious about how this tiny module works? It's quite interesting! It uses a pair of IR components - a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is like the module's flashlight, emitting infrared light. 
When an obstacle appears, the infrared light bounces back and gets caught by the receiver. The module then gives a low signal, alerting our rover of the obstacle.

Our little module is quite robust, spotting obstacles within a range of 2-40cm and boasting excellent anti-interference abilities. 
However, the color of objects does impact its sensing. Darker objects, especially black ones, are detected at a shorter range. 
Against a white wall, the sensor is most efficient, sensing within the 2-30cm range.


The **EN** pin's low-level state activates the module, with the jumper cap securing the **EN** pin to the GND. If you wish to control the **EN** pin via code, the jumper cap needs to be removed.

There are two potentiometers on the module, one for adjusting the transmitting power and one for adjusting the transmitting frequency, and by adjusting these two potentiometers you can adjust its effective distance.

That's quite a bit about our little module. In the next step, we'll learn how to integrate it with our rover and control it using the Arduino. Stay tuned!



Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Module Detection Values
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Power up the GalaxyRVR and wave your hand over the infrared obstacle avoidance modules on either side. You will see the second light illuminate when it is close to the module.

This indicates that it has detected an obstacle, in which case it sends a different signal to the main controller.

2. Let's see what these two signals are. First, :ref:`app_connet`.

3. In the GalaxyRVR category, find the left IR status and right IR status blocks. These store the detection results of the IR modules. Make sure to check the boxes for these.

.. image:: img/4_ir_statusblock.png

4. The values will now be displayed on the stage.

.. image:: img/4_ir_statusvalue.png

5. Move your hand close to the infrared obstacle avoidance modules to trigger detection and observe the value changes on the stage.

If the IR modules detect an obstacle, the value will be True; if no obstacle is detected, the value will be False.



Responding to the Infrared Obstacle Avoidance Module
-------------------------------------------------------------

We can utilize the infrared obstacle avoidance modules to make the GalaxyRVR automatically dodge obstacles on both sides.


1. Drag in a green flag block

.. image:: img/4_ir_start.png

2. Set the speed. Here we set the speed to 30%, so it isn't too fast, making it easier to debug.

.. image:: img/4_ir_speed.png


3. Find the ``when left IR is blocked`` block.

.. image:: img/4_ir_when_blocked.png

4. When the left side detects an obstacle, the GalaxyRVR should turn right.

.. image:: img/4_ir_turn_right.png

5. Keep turning right until the left side no longer detects the obstacle.

.. image:: img/4_ir_wait_until.png


6. Stop moving.

.. image:: img/4_ir_stop.png


7. Once you have assembled these blocks, try triggering the left infrared obstacle avoidance module with your hand. The GalaxyRVR will smartly turn right to avoid your hand.

8. Long-press these blocks to bring up a menu, where you can duplicate the code.

.. image:: img/4_ir_duplicate.png

9. In the duplicated code, swap the left and right sides.

.. image:: img/4_ir_left_right.png

10. You will notice that if both IR events are triggered simultaneously, the behavior may become erratic. To prevent this, the "stop other scripts in sprite" block will come in handy. It ensures that only one sensor event is responded to at a time.

.. image:: img/4_ir_stop_script.png

.. note:: The stop scripts block and blocks with time parameters (e.g., forward for 1 sec) can conflict in some cases, so avoid using them together when possible.


11. Now, the GalaxyRVR will turn left or right when obstacles are detected on either side. You can now test this by triggering both sensors with your hand to make the GalaxyRVR dodge left and right.

12. Add a forward block under each code block so that the GalaxyRVR continues to move forward after avoiding the obstacle.

.. image:: img/4_ir_avoid_move.png


Now, click the green flag, and the GalaxyRVR will move forward continuously, turning to avoid obstacles and resuming its path after avoiding them.
