## About this kit:

Built upon the same universal rocker-bogie system employed by NASA's real Mars rovers, GalaxyRVR is capable of traversing all kinds of terrains â€“ be it rocky mountains, sandy beaches, or grassy fields. The suspension system ensures smooth mobility, making the alien world of Mars feel just like home.

Equipped with a high-definition camera module, GalaxyRVR offers a first-person view, providing an immersive piloting experience as if 
you're truly navigating the Red Planet. Its advanced obstacle avoidance module and ultrasonic module ensure it can dodge obstacles, embodying a spirit of autonomy and resilience.
